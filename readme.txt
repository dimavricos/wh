1rst part (index.html)

The only library i used is jQuery


- menu
it changes to fixed as the user scolls. 
For smaller screens the main menu turns to verical and the submenu remains horizontal as user can scoll horizontally and see more links. 

- image grid
i didnt use any js plugin, html & css load faster than js


2nd part (menu.html)

i only used javascript (no any other libraries or frameworks)
